## 📌 **Introduction**

In today’s digital workplace, managing internal company data securely and efficiently is just as important as keeping a public website online. Businesses rely on cloud storage not only to serve public content, but also to store sensitive company documents, collaborate with trusted partners, and manage data storage costs wisely.

**Azure Storage** provides powerful tools to achieve all of this — allowing you to secure internal files, maintain business continuity with geo-redundancy, enable fine-grained access control, and automate data tiering for cost optimization.

This guide shows you how to build a **secure, redundant, and cost-effective private storage solution** entirely from the Azure Portal — without writing a single line of code.

✅ Secure files in private containers

✅ Enable temporary access for external partners using SAS

✅ Automate cost-saving tiering for infrequently used data

✅ Back up public website files into private storage

This configuration is perfect for internal document retention, secure B2B file sharing, and disaster recovery strategies.

---

## ⚙️ **Prerequisites**

Before starting, ensure you have:

✅ An **active Azure subscription**

✅ Basic understanding of cloud storage (blobs, containers, access levels)

✅ Access to Azure Portal

---

## 🧩 **Architecture Overview**

The solution includes:

* 🔐 A **private storage account** for sensitive documents
* 📁 **Private containers** to isolate and protect files
* 🕒 **Shared Access Signatures (SAS)** for controlled partner access
* 🧬 **Object Replication** to back up files from a public website
* 🪙 **Lifecycle Management Rules** to automatically move cold data to cheaper tiers

## 📊 **Key Configuration Table**

| **Feature**              | **Purpose**                                  | **Recommended Setting**                           |
| ------------------------ | -------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| **Redundancy**           | High availability during regional outages    | Geo-Redundant Storage (**GRS**)                   |
| **Access Control**       | Protect internal company data                | Private Containers (no public access)             |
| **SAS Access**           | Temporary file sharing with partners         | Generate SAS with scoped permissions + expiration |
| **Object Replication**   | Back up public web files into secure storage | Enabled                                           |
| **Lifecycle Management** | Optimize cost by tiering old data            | Auto-move files >30 days old to **Cool** tier     |

---

## 📦 **Step 1: Create a Storage Account with High Availability**

1️⃣ Go to Azure Portal → **Search** "Storage Accounts" → Click **+ Create**

2️⃣ Select a Resource Group (e.g., from previous labs or create one)

3️⃣ Name your account (e.g., `privatecompanydocs123`)

4️⃣ Choose **Geo-redundant Storage (GRS)** under *Redundancy*

5️⃣ Click **Review + Create** → **Create** → **Go to Resource**

🔁 This ensures your data remains available even if a region goes down.

---

## 🔒 **Step 2: Create a Private Container & Upload Test File**

1️⃣ In your storage account, go to **Data storage > Containers**

2️⃣ Click **+ Container** → Name: `sudais` → Access Level: **Private (no anonymous access)** → **Create**

📤 Upload a test file:

* Open the container → Click **Upload** → Select any small file (image, doc) → Upload
* Copy the file URL → Paste it in a browser → You should see a **403 error**
  ✅ This confirms the file is not publicly accessible.

---

## 🔐 **Step 3: Grant Partner Access with SAS**

To give a partner read access for 24 hours:

1️⃣ Select the uploaded file → Click **Generate SAS**

2️⃣ Set Permissions to **Read only**

3️⃣ Set Start and Expiry time (e.g., now + 24 hours)

4️⃣ Click **Generate SAS token and URL**

5️⃣ Share the SAS URL — they can now securely view/download the file

✅ Partner access is **scoped, temporary, and secure**.

---

## 💸 **Step 4: Configure Lifecycle Management**

Automatically optimize storage cost by moving older blobs to cooler tiers:

1️⃣ Confirm your Default Access Tier is set to **Hot**

2️⃣ Go to **Data management > Lifecycle Management**

3️⃣ Click **Add rule** → Name: `movetocool`

4️⃣ Scope: Apply to all blobs

5️⃣ Condition: **Last modified > 30 days ago**

6️⃣ Action: Move to **Cool** storage → Click **Add**

📉 This saves you money without manual intervention.

---

## 🧯 **Step 5: Back Up Public Website Files with Object Replication**

Use replication to back up your public site’s content into secure storage:

1️⃣ In your private storage, create a container: `backup`

2️⃣ In the public storage account (previously created), go to **Object Replication**

3️⃣ Click **Create replication rule**

* Source: public container (e.g., `public`)
* Destination storage: your **private account**
* Destination container: `backup`

4️⃣ Save the rule
  
5️⃣ Upload a test file to the public container
  
✅ After a few minutes, the file will appear in the private backup container.

---

## 📌 **Conclusion**

You’ve now deployed a **secure and cost-effective Azure Storage configuration**:

✅ Files are highly available with **geo-redundancy**

✅ Private containers ensure **confidentiality**

✅ **SAS tokens** enable secure, limited-time external access

✅ Lifecycle rules **reduce cost** without manual cleanup

✅ Object Replication backs up public data automatically

This is ideal for internal storage, secure file sharing, and business continuity planning.
