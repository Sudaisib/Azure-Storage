## 📌 **Introduction**

Cloud storage is a cornerstone of modern IT architecture. **Azure Files** delivers a fully managed, serverless file-sharing solution with enterprise-grade security, scalability, and performance. Whether you're supporting internal file systems or building hybrid infrastructure, Azure File Shares is a skill every cloud engineer should master.

In this lab, you'll walk through provisioning a **premium storage account**, configuring **file shares** and **snapshots**, and securing access through **Virtual Network (VNet)** and **subnet rules**.

Use Case: Simulate a secure file-sharing setup for a **finance department**, including recovery readiness and access restrictions.

---

## ⚙️ **Prerequisites**

Make sure you have:

* ✅ An **active Azure subscription**
* ✅ Basic familiarity with Azure Portal
* ✅ Understanding of storage accounts and networking (VNets, subnets)

---

## 🧰 **Architecture Overview**

This solution provisions a **Premium Storage Account** with the following:

* A **File Share** and **Directory** structure
* **Snapshots** for file recovery
* **Virtual Network** and **Subnet** access restrictions
* End-to-end access and integrity validation

| **Component**       | **Purpose**                | **Recommended Setting**      |
| ------------------- | -------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Storage Tier        | High-performance workloads | Premium (File Shares)        |
| Redundancy          | Zone-based durability      | Zone-Redundant Storage (ZRS) |
| Access Control      | Restrict file access       | VNet + Subnet restrictions   |
| Data Protection     | Enable recovery options    | Snapshots Enabled            |
| Directory Structure | Organize department data   | Root/File Share/Finance      |
| Public Access       | Harden security            | Disabled                     |

## 📦 **Step 1: Create and Configure a Storage Account**

1. Go to Azure Portal > Search "**Storage accounts**" > Click **+ Create**
2. Use an existing or create a new **Resource Group**
3. Storage account name: e.g., `ibrahimstorage`
4. **Performance**: Premium | **Account Type**: File Shares
5. **Redundancy**: Zone-Redundant (ZRS)
6. Click **Review + Create** > **Create** > **Go to Resource**

---

## 📁 **Step 2: Create File Share and Directories**

1. In your storage account, go to **File shares** > Click **+ File share**
2. Name: `ibrahimfs` > Click **Create**
3. Click into the share > Click **+ Add directory** > Name: `finance`
4. Upload a test file (`.txt` or `.csv`) to the `finance` directory

✅ You now have a functional file share with test data!

---

## 📊 **Step 3: Enable Snapshots & File Recovery**

1. Navigate to the file share > Open the **Snapshots** tab
2. Click **+ Add snapshot** > (Optional: add comment)
3. Confirm the snapshot includes all files
4. Delete your uploaded file from the `finance` directory
5. Go back to Snapshots > Open snapshot > Restore file under new name (e.g., `restore.txt`)

✅ Restored files prove snapshot recovery works as expected.

---

## 🛡️ **Step 4: Restrict Access with VNet & Subnet**

1. Search "**Virtual Networks**" > Click **+ Create**
2. Use same resource group > VNet name: `financeVNet`
3. Accept defaults > Click **Review + Create** > **Create**
4. After deployment: Go to **Subnets** > Click **default subnet**
5. Under **Service endpoints**, select `Microsoft.Storage` > **Save**

✅ This VNet will now allow secure traffic to Azure Storage.

---

## 🔒 **Step 5: Apply Network Security Rules**

1. Go back to your **Storage Account**
2. Under **Security + networking** > Select **Networking**
3. Set Public Access: `Enabled from selected networks`
4. Click **+ Add existing virtual network** > Choose `financeVNet` and `default subnet`
5. Click **Save**

Now your file share is accessible **only** from inside the VNet!

---

## 📅 **Conclusion**

You’ve now deployed a fully functional and secure **Azure Files solution**:

* ✅ Premium File Share with high availability
* ✅ VNet + Subnet for secure access
* ✅ Snapshots enabled for file-level recovery
* ✅ Real-world use case: Finance department file share

This setup demonstrates how to blend **storage**, **networking**, and **security** in Microsoft Azure to meet enterprise standards.
